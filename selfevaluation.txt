I think that this project went ok, if not a bit rough around the stylesheet parts. I could not get tumblr to link and external stylesheet for some reason, and there was little to no help from documentation. I ended up just manually inlining the stylesheet, which means I could not use pure haml to finish the html. I managed to get the images hosted offsite, and the entire page looks nice now, though.
